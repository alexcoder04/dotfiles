# NeoVim

Neovim is my text editor of choice nowadays. The config might be a little
bloated at some points and contains features I already forgot about (do I really
have NerdTree installed? :), but it works very well for me.

## Some of the key features

 - Coc plugin
 - lightline.vim plugin
 - custom bindings for navigating tabs and splits
 - building previews for MD files (handled by extra script)
 - auto-install most important of my dotfiles after editing
 - snippets for HTML, MD, LaTeX and Python
