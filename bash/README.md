# My Bash config

I don't use Bash very much - neither as interactive nor as scripting shell. My
primary usecase for the Bash shell are secondary machines as the Raspberry Pi.

## `options.*` files

These files contain options included on certain machines: `options.gopher` will
be included on the computer with the hostname "gopher".
