# i3wm

i3 is my window manager of choice. Particulary, I use a fork of i3 called
i3-gaps that has some more features.

On the wayland side an i3-compatible compositor called sway exists. The config
for it is also generated here.

I love tiling window managers, because I got tired of resizing the active window
to full-screen in floating WMs since I was a kid. Why? If I'm working on
something, I want it to get all of my screen size and all of my attention,
that's why tiling WMs just make more sense to me.

i3 is not the most advanced tiling window manager and I might try out something
different at some time in the future, but I'm sticking to i3 because of
convenience for now.

I have three different i3 setups, using i3blocks, bumblebee-status and polybar.
I switch from one to another from time to time, if I get bored. The sway setup
uses i3blocks only for now. Because of this variety, the config is split into
multiple parts, which are assembled in the right way depending on the mode.
