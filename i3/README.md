# i3wm

i3 is my window manager of choice. Particulary, I use a fork of i3 called
i3-gaps that has some more features.

I love tiling window managers, because I got tired of resizing the active window
to full-screen in floating WMs. Why? If I'm working on something, I want it to
get all of my screen size and all of my attention, that's why tiling WMs just
make more sense to me.

i3 is not the most advanced tiling window manager and I might try out something
different at some time in the future, but I'm sticking to i3 because of
convenience for now.

I have three different i3 setups, using i3blocks, bumblebee-status and polybar.
I switch from one to another from time to time, if I get bored.
