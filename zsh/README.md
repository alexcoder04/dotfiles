# The Z SHell

Zsh is my shell nowadays. My config has a bunch of features (some may say too
much), but I actually need most of them all the time.

## Essential features

 - syntax highlighting
 - fish-like abbreviation expansion
 - different cursors for insert and vim modes
 - bookmarks
 - vim navigation in menuselect
 - starship prompt
 - neofetch/colorscript at startup
 - various aliases (shorter git commands, interactive rm, ...)
