# i3-base

This is not an actual program, but the resources used by different i3
configurations. In case you didn't know: i3 is my window manager of choice.
Particulary, I use a fork of i3 called i3-gaps that has some more features.

The bar config is in a separate file because some of the configurations, like
`i3-polybar` use a different bar.
